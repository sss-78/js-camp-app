## Due Date: Wednesday, June 12, 2024 11:55 PM EST
## Objectives: Gain Practice developing a web page from an image and further practive html and css.

## Specifications/Requirements
For this project you will implement HTML/CSS for a provided page image as well as create a page of your own design.  

Part 1  
__You will define HTML and CSS to recreate the page you see in the following image [Summer Page](page.png). For this page:__

1.  Implement the HTML code in the __[index.html](index.html)__ file.
2.  The title (to be used with the &lt;title&gt; tag) for the document will be "UMD HTML/CSS Summer Camp."
3.  Implement the CSS in the __[SummerCamp.css](SummerCamp.css)__ file.
4.  Do not add CSS to the HTML file at all (if you do, you will lose credit).  
5.  The HTML/CSS should generate a page that looks very close to the image we have provided.
6.  When a user clicks on the University of MD globe, a new page/tab will open with the CS Department website (www.cs.umd.edu).
7.  When users hover over the first paragraph (the one starting with "The UMD ...") the color of the text must change from brown to red.
8.  Colors used by this page: black, antiquewhite, brown, white, red, and blue.
9.  You can use the __&lt;hr&gt;__ tag to create a horizontal rule (line).
10.  The only unit you can use in the CSS file is __rem__ (except for the __html__ element which we have already set to be 14px). Do not use em either; only use rem. You will lose credit if you use a unit other than rem.
11.  The "Campus Tour" link is https://www.umd.edu/virtual-tour
12.  When you hover over the "Campus Tour" link the message "Virtual Tour" should appear (use the title attribute).
13.  Set a link to the "[Instructor.html](Instructor.html)" file.
14.  All your CSS for this page must appear in the __[SummerCamp.css](SummerCamp.css)__ file.
15.  You must use at least one class selector.
16.  You must use at least one id selector.
17.  You will lose credit if your HTML does not validate according to the HTML Validator (https://validator.w3.org/)
18.  You do not need to validate your CSS although it is recommended.  

Part 2  
Implement a page of your own design  
You will define HTML and CSS to define a page of a topic you choose. For this page:

1.  Implement the HTML code in the [Instructor.html](Instructor.html) file.
2.  Any CSS should be in the external CSS file, [Instructor.css](Instructor.css).
3.  You can add additional HTML or CSS files.
4.  If you add images, make sure they are small, otherwise pushing to gitlab could fail.  
5.  If you add images, make sure you specify a relative path, instead of an absolute path that corresponds to a path in your computer.
6.  You need to use the following HTML tags in your page, otherwise you will lose credit.
    *  A table that relies on &lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tbody&gt; (&lt;tfoot&gt; is optional).
    *  You need to use a google font. The font may not be one used by lecture examples.
    *  A link to a YouTube video.
    *  The page background must have a picture.
7.  Add a favicon to your page. There are several favicon generators you can find online. One generator can be found at https://realfavicongenerator.net/.
8.  Feel free to use any other HTML tags.
9.  You don't need to validate your HTML or CSS for this page, but it is recommended.


Part 3  
Other Specifications and Submssion  
*  You may not use any authoring tool (e.g., Dreamweaver, ChatGPT, YourCSFriendGPT, etc.) that generates the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code for you.
*  You may not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, or any other type of library/framework.
*  You must implement this project by yourself.
Make sure you view your code using Chrome (that is the browser we will use to grade your project).
*  You can use any HTML/CSS code we have provided in lecture examples.
*  You will need to commit your changes and push them to your repository on the University Gitlab server. __After you push your changes you should verify that you see your code in your repo in the cloud.__
